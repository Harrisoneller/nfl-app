# Prediction Models — Reference Spec

A complete inventory of every prediction surface, the math behind each, the
inputs it consumes, and where it lives in the codebase.

---

## 1. Team Elo Ratings

**File:** `backend/app/services/elo_service.py`

The foundation. Every team-level prediction (game outcomes, season sims, H2H,
betting edge) ultimately reads from these ratings.

**Constants**
| Param | Value | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `K_FACTOR` | 20 | Standard NFL Elo update rate. Lower than NBA (~25) since fewer games = less noise per outcome. |
| `HOME_FIELD_ADVANTAGE` | 55 | ≈ +2.2 spread points; near league-historical HFA. |
| `INITIAL_RATING` | 1500 | League average. |
| `SEASON_REGRESSION` | 0.75 | Carry forward 75% of last year's rating, blend 25% toward 1500 — so good teams cool off, bad teams heat up. |
| `ELO_PER_POINT` | 25 | Elo difference per point of expected margin. |

**Math**

Win probability of home team:
```
diff = home_rating - away_rating + HFA
win_prob = 1 / (1 + 10^(-diff/400))
```

Predicted spread (sportsbook convention; negative = home favored):
```
spread = -(diff / 25)
```

Update after a played game (538-style margin-of-victory dampening):
```
expected_home = win_probability(home_rating, away_rating)
actual_home = 1 if home_margin > 0 else 0 (0.5 for ties)
mov_mult = ln(|margin| + 1) × (2.2 / (|elo_diff| × 0.001 + 2.2))
delta = K × mov_mult × (actual_home - expected_home)
new_home_rating = home_rating + delta
new_away_rating = away_rating - delta
```

**Persistence**
- Stored per `(team_id, season, week)` in `team_elo_ratings` table.
- `Week 0` = pre-season baseline (after season regression applied).
- `Week N` = rating after game N.
- Backfilled for the last 6 seasons on first boot; refreshed weekly.

**Inputs**
- Completed game scores (`home_score`, `away_score`) from `nfl-data-py` schedules.
- Home/away assignment, neutral-site flag (Super Bowl, international games).

**Letter grade** (casual-fan display):
```
A+: ≥1660    B+: ≥1550    C+: ≥1460    D: ≥1370
A:  ≥1620    B:  ≥1520    C:  ≥1430    F: <1370
A-: ≥1580    B-: ≥1490    C-: ≥1400
```

## 2. Game-Level Predictions (Elo)

**File:** `backend/app/services/predictions_service.py` → `predict_game`

The simplest user-visible prediction: win probability, predicted spread,
predicted total, predicted score, and a one-word game-script label.

**Inputs**
- `home_rating`, `away_rating` — current Elo ratings
- `home_off_ppg`, `away_off_ppg` — season points-per-game (offense)
- `home_def_ppg_allowed`, `away_def_ppg_allowed` — season points-allowed
- `neutral_site` flag

**Outputs**
- `home_win_prob` and `away_win_prob` — from Elo formula
- `predicted_spread` — from Elo diff
- `predicted_total` — `(home_off + away_def_allowed)/2 + (away_off + home_def_allowed)/2`
- `predicted_home_score` / `predicted_away_score` — derived from total + spread
- `game_script` — text label:
  - `total ≥ 48` → **Shootout**
  - `total ≤ 40` → **Defensive grind**
  - `|spread| ≥ 7` → **Blowout potential**
  - `|spread| ≤ 2.5` → **Toss-up**
  - else → **Methodical**

**Where this surfaces**
- Home page hero card (most compelling game of the week)
- Team page → Overview → "Next game" card
- Team page → Predictions tab (full slate)
- Betting tab → Edge vs market
- H2H page → Prediction hero
- AI tool: `get_current_scoreboard`

## 3. Monte Carlo Season Simulator

**File:** `backend/app/services/predictions_service.py` → `simulate_season`

Powers the "what's our predicted record / playoff %" headline. Runs 10,000
trials of the remaining season schedule.

**Algorithm**
```
For each simulation (10,000 of them):
    For each unplayed game on the schedule:
        wp = win_probability(home_elo, away_elo)
        if random() < wp: home wins
        else: away wins
    Compute division winners (top of each 4-team div)
    Compute wildcards (top 3 non-winners per conf)
    Mark playoff appearances
    Mark "best record in conference" as SB appearance proxy
    Record total wins per team
```

**Output per team**
- `mean_wins`, `p5_wins`, `median_wins`, `p95_wins`
- `division_winner_pct`
- `playoff_pct`
- `sb_appearance_pct` (crude — "best record in conference," not a real bracket sim)

**Inputs**
- Current Elo ratings (held constant within a single sim — not re-updated game-to-game)
- Remaining schedule
- Banked W/L from already-completed games

**Known limitations**
- Elo doesn't update during a sim, which slightly under-states variance.
- SB appearance % is best-record-in-conference, not bracket simulation.

**Cache:** 30 minutes; pre-warmed on boot.

**Where this surfaces**
- Home page → Projected standings
- Team page → Overview → Season outlook card
- Team page → Predictions tab

## 4. ML Layer — XGBoost Margin Model

**File:** `backend/app/services/ml_predictions_service.py`

A second-opinion model that runs alongside Elo predictions. Surfaces on the
team Predictions tab when the model disagrees with Elo by ≥0.5 points.

**Algorithm**
- **Type:** XGBoost regression
- **Target:** `home_margin = home_score - away_score`
- **Hyperparameters:** `n_estimators=300, max_depth=4, learning_rate=0.05, subsample=0.85, colsample_bytree=0.85`
- **Training data:** Last 4 completed seasons (configurable via `/predictions/admin/ml/train?seasons=...`)

**Features (10)**
| Feature | Source |
|---|---|
| `home_elo`, `away_elo` | Pre-game Elo |
| `home_off_epa`, `away_off_epa` | Rolling 4-week offensive EPA/play |
| `home_def_epa`, `away_def_epa` | Rolling 4-week defensive EPA/play |
| `rest_days_home`, `rest_days_away` | Days since last game (clamped 3-21) |
| `is_division_game` | 1/0 |
| `week_number` | Schedule week |

**Performance**
- In-sample MAE typically ~9.4 points (NFL spread MAE is ~10-13 for sharp models).
- **Not yet validated out-of-sample** — see `MODELS.md > priorities` below.

**Persistence**
- Trained model saved to `/tmp/nfl_margin_xgb.json` (configurable via `ML_MODEL_DIR`).
- Reloaded into memory on first inference call after restart.

**Trigger**
- Manual via `POST /predictions/admin/ml/train`. Not retrained automatically yet.

## 5. Player Game Projections (v2 — `player-proj-v2`)

**Files:** `backend/app/services/player_projection_engine.py` (pure math) +
`backend/app/services/player_predictions_service.py` (orchestration) →
`player_game_predictions`

Distribution-first stat projections for a player's next ~8 games, coupled to
the game model. Every stat ships `mean + sd` (plus 50%/80% intervals and
anytime-TD probability), so P(over any prop line) derives from the same
distribution the UI displays.

**Pipeline (per stat)**
```
# 1. Prior: up to 3 prior seasons, recency-weighted (1.0 / 0.55 / 0.30),
#    games-weighted (injury seasons count less), aged by positional curve.
#    Rookies fall back to position × draft-capital archetype priors.
prior_mean, prior_game_sd, prior_n = build_prior(...)   # prior_n = pseudo-games

# 2. In-season Bayesian update (dynamic week-to-week adjustment):
post_mean = (prior_n × prior_mean + n_obs × obs_mean) / (prior_n + n_obs)
talent_sd = post_game_sd / sqrt(prior_n + n_obs)        # shrinks as evidence accrues

# 3. Game coupling — from predict_game outputs for THIS matchup:
env = (team_implied_pts / 22) ^ elasticity              # TDs ~1.0, yards 0.55, volume 0.30
    × (1 + script_tilt(expected_margin))                # favored → rush up/pass down, ±12%
    × positional_defense_factor(opp, stat_family)       # pass / rush / recv_WR / recv_RB / recv_TE

# 4. Compose v1 multipliers:
mean = post_mean × env × weather_mult × injury_mult
sd   = post_game_sd                                     # multipliers shift means only
```

**Consensus-tightening layers** (keep projections near market unless the evidence disagrees):
- **Role share** — Sleeper depth-chart order scales the whole distribution
  (QB2 → ×0.05: winner-take-all; RB/WR/TE decay gently). Per-game history is
  availability-biased (backups only log stats when they start), so without
  this a career backup projects like a starter. Roster gate + role gate keep
  retired/FA players and sub-0.30-role backups off the leaderboard; QB rooms
  with missing depth data are ranked by projected passing volume.
- **Positional regression (Marcel)** — every prior is shrunk toward the
  positional starter mean by 3 pseudo-games (`POSITION_SHRINK_K`), heavy for
  thin histories, light for 3-season vets.
- **Market anchoring** — when ≥2 books post a prop line for the next game,
  volume/yardage means blend toward the consensus line by 12%/book (cap 40%);
  response carries `market_anchor {line, books, weight, raw_mean}`. Prop edges
  are computed off the anchored distribution — residual disagreement only.
- **Env clamp** — the combined game-environment multiplier is capped to
  0.75–1.30 so compounding components never produce swings the market doesn't price.

**Inputs**
- Weekly game logs, up to 4 seasons (`nfl-data-py`), keyed by GSIS id
- Game predictor outputs per remaining game: implied points, expected margin, game script
- Opponent positional defense factors (yards allowed per game to QB/RB/WR/TE, shrunk 50% to league mean, clamped 0.80–1.25)
- Weather forecast (Open-Meteo) + Sleeper injury status (same tables as v1)

**Per-stat coverage by position** (fantasy points are *derived* from components for PPR / half-PPR / standard)
- **QB:** attempts, completions, passing_yards, passing_tds, interceptions, carries, rushing_yards, rushing_tds
- **RB:** carries, rushing_yards, rushing_tds, targets, receptions, receiving_yards, receiving_tds
- **WR / TE:** targets, receptions, receiving_yards, receiving_tds

**Matchup grade** (from the opponent's positional defense factor)
```
factor ≥ 1.10 → A  (defense leaks this stat family)
factor ≥ 1.03 → B
factor ≥ 0.97 → C
factor ≥ 0.90 → D
factor < 0.90 → F  (elite vs this family)
```

**Evaluation:** `GET /predictions/backtest/players` — walk-forward on a completed
season (posterior from prior seasons + weeks < W only): MAE, CRPS, and 50%/80%
interval coverage per stat. Coverage ≈ nominal is the honesty check (the player
analogue of the game model's PIT test).

**Weather multipliers**
| Condition | Passing | Receiving | Rushing | Fantasy |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Indoor / dome | ×1.00 | ×1.00 | ×1.00 | ×1.00 |
| Wind ≥ 25 mph | ×0.85 | ×0.88 | (+4% bonus) | weighted blend |
| Wind 15–24 mph | ×0.92 | ×0.94 | unchanged | weighted blend |
| Precip ≥ 0.4 in | ×0.85 | ×0.88 | (+4% bonus) | weighted blend |
| Precip 0.15–0.4 in | ×0.93 | ×0.95 | unchanged | weighted blend |
| Temp ≤ 25 °F | ×0.95 | ×1.00 | unchanged | weighted blend |

**Injury multipliers**
| Status | Multiplier |
|---|---|
| `OUT` / `IR` / `PUP` / `NFI` / `SUSPENDED` | 0.00 |
| `DOUBTFUL` | 0.30 |
| `QUESTIONABLE` | 0.85 |
| `PROBABLE` / `ACTIVE` / `HEALTHY` / unknown | 1.00 |

## 6. Player Season Projections (v2)

**File:** `backend/app/services/player_predictions_service.py` → `player_season_projection`

YTD + remaining-schedule projection with a full season distribution
(p10/p25/p50/p75/p90) per stat, plus fantasy-point distributions for PPR,
half-PPR, and standard scoring.

**Formula**
```
# Per-game means computed against each REMAINING opponent's game environment
game_means = [post_mean × env(game) for game in remaining_schedule]
projected_remaining = sum(game_means)
projected_final = ytd + projected_remaining

# Two-component variance — mirrors the hierarchical season Monte Carlo (§2):
#   talent error is correlated across the whole slate; week noise is not.
season_sd = sqrt(G² × talent_sd² + G × game_sd²)
quantiles = Normal(projected_final, season_sd) truncated at 0
```

The correlated talent term is what keeps early-season bands honest: with few
observed games `talent_sd` is large and the p10–p90 range is wide; it tightens
automatically as the Bayesian posterior absorbs real games.

**Related endpoints**
- `GET /players/projections/leaderboard` — bulk season projections for the
  fantasy-relevant pool (~90/position), ranked by projected fantasy points
- `GET /players/{id}/over-prob?stat=&line=` — P(stat > line) next game, from
  the same distribution
- `GET /players/{id}/props` + `GET /players/props/edges` — sportsbook prop
  consensus (median line, de-vigged) vs model P(over); edge = model − market
  (see `player_props_service`, append-only `player_prop_snapshots`)

---

## 7. Award Race Odds

**File:** `backend/app/services/awards_service.py`

MVP + OPOY leaderboards derived from existing player percentile data.

**MVP composite (QB-only)**
| Metric | Weight |
|---|---|
| passing_yards | 0.18 |
| passing_tds | 0.18 |
| epa_per_play | 0.18 |
| fantasy_points_ppr | 0.16 |
| passer_rating | 0.12 |
| yards_per_attempt | 0.10 |
| success_rate | 0.08 |

**OPOY composite (RB/WR/TE)**
| Metric | Weight |
|---|---|
| fantasy_points_ppr | 0.20 |
| receiving_yards | 0.18 |
| rushing_yards | 0.18 |
| receiving_tds | 0.12 |
| rushing_tds | 0.12 |
| wopr | 0.10 |
| epa_per_play | 0.10 |

**Math**
```
For each player:
    composite = Σ (percentile_rank(player, metric) × weight)
For top 10:
    odds_pct = softmax(composite_scores, temperature=8.0)
```

Tempered softmax (temperature 8) sharpens the distribution so the leader gets
realistic odds (~30-40% for a dominant season) instead of being flat.

**Output**
- Sorted top 10 by composite
- Each with `composite_score` (0-100) and `odds_pct` (normalized via softmax)

**Caveat:** This is a *performance* ranking, not actual betting odds. The
formula doesn't account for narrative bias (winning team often gets MVP
boost), defensive players (DPOY skipped because we don't track them deeply),
or rookies.

---

## 8. Betting / Edge Detection

**File:** `backend/app/services/betting_service.py`

**Historical ATS/O/U records**
- Computed from `spread_line` and `total_line` in `nfl-data-py` schedules (closing lines, free).
- 5 seasons back by default.
- Splits: SU, ATS, O/U, as favorite/underdog, home/away.

**ATS math (home perspective)**
```
home_covered = (home_score - away_score) > spread_line
home_push    = (home_score - away_score) == spread_line
away_covered = (away_score - home_score) > -spread_line
```

**Edge vs market**
- Pulls current sportsbook odds from The Odds API.
- Takes median of all book spreads + totals per game (the "consensus").
- Compares to our predicted spread/total.

```
edge_spread = market_spread_home - our_predicted_spread
edge_total  = our_predicted_total - market_total
```

- `edge_spread > 0` → we think home is even more favored than market does
- `|edge_spread| ≥ 2.0` → flagged as a "value bet"

**Where this surfaces**
- Team page → Betting tab → Edge vs market
- Home page → League-wide best bets card
- API: `/betting/edge`, `/betting/best-bets`

---

## 9. Head-to-Head Cross-Side Matchup

**File:** `backend/app/services/h2h_service.py` → `_cross_side_matchups`

The analyst-style "strength vs weakness" view.

**Paired metrics (offense vs opponent's defensive counterpart)**
| Offense | Opp defense allowed | Label |
|---|---|---|
| `points_per_game` | `points_allowed_per_game` | Scoring |
| `off_epa_per_play` | `def_epa_per_play` | EPA / play |
| `off_success_rate` | `def_success_rate` | Success rate |
| `off_yards_per_play` | `def_yards_per_play` | Yards / play |
| `off_explosive_play_rate` | `def_explosive_play_rate` | Explosive rate |
| `off_red_zone_td_pct` | `def_red_zone_td_pct` | Red-zone TD% |
| `off_third_down_pct` | `def_third_down_pct` | 3rd-down conv% |

**Math (per pairing)**
```
expected = (offense_value + opp_defense_allowed) / 2
delta    = offense_value - opp_defense_allowed
offense_has_edge = delta > 0
```

`expected` is the model's quick answer to "what should we expect for this
stat in this game?" — midpoint of the offense's pace and what the opponent
typically allows. Green delta = offense projects above what the defense
typically allows.

---

## 10. Market-Aware Layer (`market-blend-v1`)

The closing line beats every public model, ours included — so the headline
predictions are now a **model↔market blend** rather than pure model output.
Three components, all best-effort (any dead source degrades to model-only):

**Game blend** (`market_service.py`). The persisted `odds_lines` snapshot is
de-vigged per book (h2h pairs), medianed across books, and optionally merged
with Kalshi prediction-market prices (counted as 2 book-equivalents). Win
probs blend in **logit space**, spread/total linearly, with market weight
`min(0.85, 0.30 + 0.10 × effective_sources)` — one lonely book carries 40%,
a full 5+-book consensus ~80%+. Pure-model numbers are preserved under
`model_only`, and `edge` exposes model−market disagreement per game (that gap
is the value signal, not an error). Line movement (open→latest from Sparky's
append-only `odds_snapshots`) is attached as context but deliberately not used
as an extra nudge — the current line already contains it. Admin overrides
still supersede everything at read time.

**Price-aware prop anchors** (`player_projection_engine.market_implied_mean`,
`poisson_rate_from_over_prob`). Anchoring now uses the de-vigged over price,
not just the line: for yardage/volume, `m = line + sd·Φ⁻¹(P(over))` (shift
capped at ±0.8 sd); for TD/INT props, the threshold price inverts to a
market-implied Poisson rate — so scoring stats, previously excluded from
anchoring, now anchor whenever a usable price exists (weight cap 0.30 vs 0.40).

**Fantasy market** (`fantasy_market_service.py`). FantasyFootballCalculator
ADP (free, keyless, per scoring format) + Sleeper 24h trending adds, matched
by normalized name. Every leaderboard row carries a `market` block (`adp`,
ranks, `trending_adds`, `value_vs_adp` = ADP rank − model rank) and a
`consensus_rank_score` blending model and market ranks; `sort=consensus`
orders by it. The ADP weight starts at 0.55 preseason and decays 0.045/week to
a 0.15 floor — the same prior→evidence handoff the Bayesian player engine uses.

**Season-board calibration (the "market-blind #3 overall" fix).** Three
mechanisms keep season fantasy ranks near market unless the evidence earns the
gap:

1. *ADP anchor* (`fantasy_market_service.apply_adp_anchor`). Board fantasy
   projections shrink toward the market-implied level before ranking. The
   mapping is order-statistics and self-calibrating: the market's positional
   rank (ADP) is read off OUR OWN projected per-game curve — "market says
   RB11" becomes "market says he scores like our 11th-best RB". Anchor weight
   = the decaying ADP weight above; admin overrides still applied after and
   win outright.
2. *Stat-class prior shrinkage* (`engine.POSITION_SHRINK_K`, now per class:
   volume 2, yardage 3, scoring 6). TD/INT rates — the most
   regression-prone stats in football, and the classic way a goal-line back
   gets over-ranked — regress twice as hard toward the positional mean as
   yardage.
3. *Durability discount* (`engine.availability_rate`). Expected share of the
   remaining slate from the player's own games-played history
   (recency-weighted, shrunk toward positional norms: RB 0.87, QB 0.94,
   WR/TE 0.90; floor 0.65). Scales season means only — the untouched sd keeps
   the band honest about missed-time risk. Applied on both the leaderboard and
   the player-page season projection; weekly (single-game) projections are
   untouched, since availability is a slate concept.

---

## 11. Model-Input Levers (admin)

Output overrides pin one number and leave its neighbors inconsistent. Input
levers (`model_inputs_service.py`, admin → Model Inputs tab) adjust what the
model *believes* and let the pipeline recompute everything downstream — the
right tool for coaching changes, scheme changes, and role changes the data
can't see yet. Storage reuses `admin_overrides` (season-scoped, `week IS
NULL`); reverting a lever instantly restores pure model output, and every
hooked cache key embeds the overrides version.

**Team levers** (`entity_type='team'`): `pace` (off plays/gm),
`yards_per_play`, `pass_rate` (neutral), `points_per_game`. Baselines come
from the same PBP aggregates the scoring model reads. Pace and YPP multiply
expected scoring (elasticity 1.0 / 0.9, ratios clamped ±25%);
`points_per_game` is a direct level-set that supersedes both; `pass_rate` is
volume-neutral and instead tilts pass-family volume vs rush-family volume for
every player on the roster. Applied in `predict_week`,
`team_remaining_schedule_predictions`, and `league_game_environments` — so
totals, spreads, scripts, and player environments move together.

**Player levers** (`entity_type='player'`, PLAYER_INPUT_FIELDS):
`target_share`, `rush_share`, `yards_per_target`, `yards_per_carry`,
`snap_rate`. Baselines are computed from the last completed season's weekly
frame (+ nflverse snap counts). Each lever scales posterior rates by
(override ÷ baseline), clamped: shares move their whole stat family's
distribution (like role multipliers), efficiency moves yardage 1:1 and TDs at
0.5 elasticity, snap rate scales everything. Applied in `_collect_candidates`
(season + weekly boards), `player_game_predictions`, and
`player_season_projection`; responses expose the applied multipliers under
`input_levers`. A lever with no baseline is a no-op — surfaced as inactive in
the admin UI, never a silent distortion.

## 12. Global Parameter Registry (`param_registry`)

Every judgment-call constant in the projection stack — Elo K-factor and HFA,
market blend weights, scoring elasticities, game-script sensitivities, prop
anchor caps, defense shrink/clamps, ADP decay, lever elasticities, margin and
total sigmas — is declared once as a `ParamSpec` in
`services/param_registry.py` (key, label, description, code default, hard
bounds, category, affected surfaces) and read at call time via
`param_registry.value("elo.k_factor")`. ~45 tunables across 9 categories.

**Resolution order**: preview overlay (context-local) → `model_params` DB row
→ code default. No DB row means exact pre-registry behavior; any DB failure
fails open to defaults. Values are process-cached ~15 s and every write bumps
a version token that is compounded into `overrides_service.version()`, so a
parameter change invalidates every downstream projection cache and is live on
all replicas within seconds — no deploy, no restart.

**Write path** (`model_params_service`, `/admin/params/*`, admin → Parameters
tab): bounds validation plus cross-param pair rules (clamp floors must stay
below ceilings, `market.w_base` below `market.w_cap`); every set / revert /
preset action appends to `admin_audit_log` (also fed by entity overrides —
one unified Change Log timeline with old value, new value, actor, note).

**Presets** (`model_param_presets`): named snapshots of the full
deviation-from-default configuration ("preseason", "sharp-market weeks").
Applying a preset sets its keys and reverts every other override — the preset
IS the configuration, not a patch.

**Impact preview** (`POST /admin/params/preview`): staged changes are applied
through a context-local overlay (never persisted), the week's game slate and
player board are recomputed under them (the overlay also rewrites the cache
version token, so previews never collide with live caches), and the response
is a per-game / per-player before→after diff with summary stats. Caveats:
Elo ratings are rebuilt by the batch job, so K-factor / season-regression
changes preview as no-ops until the next rebuild; the market consensus cache
(~10 min) can lag a Kalshi-weight change by one cycle.

**Adding a tunable** is a one-liner: declare the `ParamSpec`, read it with
`value()` at the point of use (never at import time). It then appears in the
admin UI, validation, audit, presets, and preview automatically.
