"""Admin projection overrides — the manual-adjustment layer.

An ``AdminOverride`` is one hand-set value that supersedes a model output at
read time. The model keeps producing its own numbers; overrides are applied
on top when responses are built, so a model re-run never wipes an adjustment
and deleting the row instantly reverts to pure model output.

Scope semantics
---------------
* ``entity_type='game'``  — ``entity_id`` is the nflverse game_id.
  Fields: ``predicted_spread``, ``predicted_total``, ``home_win_prob``.
* ``entity_type='player'`` — ``entity_id`` is the Player.id.
  Week-scoped fields: any projected stat key (``passing_yards``,
  ``receiving_tds``, …) or ``fantasy_points_<fmt>`` (ppr/half_ppr/standard).
  Week-scoped rank pin: ``pos_rank`` (start/sit board position rank).
  Season-scoped (``week IS NULL``) rank pin: ``rank`` (season leaderboard).
  Season-scoped INPUT fields (``week IS NULL``, PLAYER_INPUT_FIELDS): usage
  levers — ``target_share``, ``rush_share``, ``yards_per_target``,
  ``yards_per_carry``, ``snap_rate`` — that scale the projection *inputs*
  (posterior rates) rather than pinning outputs. For a role change the input
  lever is the right tool: every downstream stat, prop probability, and
  fantasy number moves consistently.
* ``entity_type='team'`` — ``entity_id`` is the team id (e.g. "KC").
  Season-scoped input levers (TEAM_INPUT_FIELDS): offense — ``pace``,
  ``yards_per_play``, ``pass_rate``, ``points_per_game``; defense —
  ``points_allowed_per_game``, ``def_yards_per_play``. Offense levers
  adjust scoring-model inputs; defense levers reshape points allowed so
  opponent matchups and player environments recompute together.

``original_value`` snapshots what the model said at the moment the override
was created — purely informational, shown in the admin UI as "model" vs
"yours".
